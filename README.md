# Hi there, I'm Donald üëã

Double lung and liver transplant recipient: The 141st person to undergo the combined procedure at Penn Medicine. From a foundation in design and 12 years of leadership in finance, I am now excelling in artificial intelligence and digital health. Currently pursuing an MSc in **AI and Digital Health** at Westminster University, I am developing tools on GitHub to empower scientists to navigate the complexities of the UK Biobank and other research databases via cloud services. I am a fast learner who thrives on tackling complexity and delivering results in challenging, high-stakes projects.  

## üî≠ Current Projects

- **MSc Research Project**: Investigating whether UK Biobank studies converge on a universal ‚Äúcore‚Äù set of features or fragment into siloed groups. The project applies a **three-stage hybrid feature-extraction pipeline**, combining large-scale PDF-to-JSON conversion, semantic chunking, advanced text cleaning, and feature-matching with LLM validation. Methods such as bootstrap resampling, Gini coefficients, and multi-stage matching are used to strengthen reproducibility and reduce false positives in feature selection. The goal is to refine scientific validity and provide a stronger framework for understanding how research fields use UK Biobank data.  
  *Confidentiality Note: Full methodological details and results are withheld pending dissertation submission and academic review.*  
- **UK Biobank RAP Interaction Tool**: Developing a GitHub repository [biobankly](https://github.com/biobankly) to simplify interaction with the new UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform (RAP). Also building [dodo.biobankly.com](https://dodo.biobankly.com), a working demo to showcase simplified data access workflows.
