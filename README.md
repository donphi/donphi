# Hi there, I'm Donald 👋

Cystic fibrosis double-lung transplant recipient at Penn Medicine three years ago, I am now forging an extraordinary path from a foundation in design and 12 years of leadership in finance to excelling in genomic data, artificial intelligence, and digital health. Currently pursuing a master's at Westminster University, I am developing cutting-edge tools on GitHub to empower scientists to navigate the complexities of the UK Biobank and other research databases via cloud services. I am an incredibly fast learner who thrives on tackling complexity and delivering results in challenging, high-stakes projects. I seek a December-January internship to refine my skills and contribute to meaningful work. With a drive to prove myself, I am a valuable candidate for a small, established group of scientists seeking an individual with multiple skills and a passion for making a transformative impact.
