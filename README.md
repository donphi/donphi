# 🚀 Donald Philp: Research Engineer (AI, Large-Scale Data Systems)

Survivor of a combined double-lung and liver transplant (141st globally at Penn Medicine). This experience reshaped my priorities: I now build infrastructure and tooling that strengthen scientific reliability and accelerate discovery.

My background spans design, high-stakes operations, and 12 years of leadership in finance. Today, I focus on **AI systems engineering**:large-scale multimodal pipelines, reproducible ML workflows, and research-enabling infrastructure for biomedical science. I am completing an MSc in **Artificial Intelligence & Digital Health** at Westminster while developing high-throughput research tooling on GitHub.

I thrive in environments with hard technical problems, high ambiguity, and complex data flows. My focus is the **system**, not the spotlight: building the foundations that make scientific and ML workflows robust, scalable, and trustworthy.

## 🔭 Current Work

### **1. Large-Scale Scientific Pipeline (PDF → JSON → Ontology-Aligned Metadata)**
A 23-stage, GPU-aware multimodal pipeline integrating Docling, Marker, LayoutLMv3-DocLayNet, PaddleOCR, and a custom token-spine alignment framework.

- Designed for **8,500+ UK Biobank papers**; scalable to **6–20M biomedical papers**
- Deterministic manifests, structured logs, hardware-adaptive batch tuning
- Ontology-aligned extraction (EFO, HPO, MONDO, LOINC)
- Distributed embedding + retrieval using vLLM, FAISS, Elasticsearch

### **2. UK Biobank Research Analysis – Core/Periphery Feature Mapping**
Investigating whether UK Biobank studies converge on a stable “core” feature set or fragment into independent silos.

- Semantic chunking, multimodal extraction, ontology matching
- Bootstrap stability analysis, Gini coefficients, feature overlap metrics
- Designed for **reproducible meta-research** and bias detection  
*Some details withheld pending dissertation submission.*

### **3. Biobankly : Simplifying RAP Workflows**
Building tools to streamline access to the UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform.

- GitHub: https://github.com/biobankly
- Demo: https://dodo.biobankly.com

Focus: user-friendly, cloud-based execution of reproducible R and Python workflows.
